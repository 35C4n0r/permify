title: Run using Docker
---

This section shows how to run Permify using our docker container. You can run Permify using Docker with following command.

## Run in a terminal

```shell
docker run -p 3476:3476 -p 3478:3478 -v {YOUR-CONFIG-PATH}:/config ghcr.io/permify/permify serve
```

This will start a Permify server with the configuration that is in `{YOUR-CONFIG-PATH}`.

### Configure with a YAML file

This config path - `{YOUR-CONFIG-PATH}` - should contain the [config yaml file](../configuration), where you can configure the Permify Server as well as define the ***database*** to store your authorization related data in.

<Info>
By default, the container is configured to listen on ports 3476 (HTTP) and 3478 (gRPC) and store the authorization data in memory rather than an actual database.
</Info>

### Configure Using Flags

Alternatively, you can set configuration options using flags when running the command. See all the configuration flags by running,

```shell
docker run -p 3476:3476 -p 3478:3478 ghcr.io/permify/permify serve -help
```

<Info>
In addition to CLI flags, Permify also supports configuration via environment variables. 

You can replace any flag with an environment variable by converting dashes into underscores and prefixing with PERMIFY_ (e.g. **--log-level** becomes **PERMIFY_LOG_LEVEL**). 
</Info>

### Test your connection.

You can test your connection by making an HTTP GET request,

```shell
localhost:3476/healthz
```

You can use our Postman Collection to work with the API. Also see the [Using the API] section for details of core functions.
