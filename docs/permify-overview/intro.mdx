## What is Permify ?

[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an **open-source authorization service** for creating fine-grained and scalable authorization systems.

With Permify, you can easily structure your authorization model, store authorization data in your preferred database, and interact with the Permify API to handle all authorization queries from your applications or services.

Permify is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar](https://permify.co/post/google-zanzibar-in-a-nutshell/).

## Motivation

Building scalable authorization systems is hard and time-consuming, and we're here to overcome this!

Our goal is to make Google‚Äôs Zanzibar available to everyone and help engineering teams build a robust, flexible, and easily auditable authorization system, which will centrally position itself in your environment, taking responsibility for access control among your applications and services.

See the [Authorization As A Service](./authorization-service) section to learn why building authorization is challenging and how our approach significantly reduces engineering efforts and secures future-proof access control systems.

## With Permify, you can:

üîÆ Create permissions and policies using [Permify's flexible authorization language](../getting-started/modeling) that is compatible with traditional roles and permissions (RBAC), arbitrary relations between users and objects (ReBAC), and attributes (ABAC).

üîê [Manage and store authorization data](../getting-started/sync-data) in your preferred database with high availability and consistency.

‚úÖ [Interact with the Permify API](../getting-started/enforcement) to perform access checks, filter your resources with specific permissions, perform bulk permission checks for various resources, and more.

üß™ Test your authorization logic with [Permify's schema testing](../getting-started/testing). You can conduct scenario-based testing, policy coverage analysis, and IDL parser integration to achieve end-to-end validations for your desired authorization schema.

‚öôÔ∏è Create custom and isolated authorization models for different applications using Permify [Multi-Tenancy](../use-cases/multi-tenancy) support, all managed within a single place, Permify instance.

## Getting Started

In Permify, authorization is divided into 3 core aspects; **modeling**, **storing authorization data** and **interacting with the APIs**.  

- See how to [Model your Authorization] using Permify Schema.
- Learn how Permify will [Store Authorization Data] as relations.
- Perform [Access Checks] anywhere in your stack.

[Model your Authorization]: ../getting-started/modeling
[Store Authorization Data]: ../getting-started/sync-data
[Access Checks]: ../getting-started/enforcement

This document explains how Permify handles these aspects to provide a robust and scalable authorization system for your applications. 

For the ones that want to try it out and examine it instantly, use [Permify Playground](https://play.permify.co/) to get started!
