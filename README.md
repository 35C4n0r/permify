## What is Permify?
[Permify](https://github.com/Permify/permify) is an **open-source authorization service** for creating and maintaining fine-grained authorizations in your applications.

With Permify you can model common authorization patterns, store authorization relevant data in your own server, and interact with Permify API to respond to all authorization questions from any of your applications.

Permify's data model is inspired by Google‚Äôs consistent, global authorization system, [Google Zanzibar Paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/41f08f03da59f5518802898f68730e247e23c331.pdf).

## Permify works best:

- If you already have an identity/auth solution and want to plug in fine-grained authorization on top of that.
- If you want to create a unified access control mechanism to use across your individual applications.
- If you want to make future-proof authorization system and don't want to spend engineering effort for it.
- If you‚Äôre managing authorization for growing micro-service infrastructure.
- If your authorization logic is cluttering your code base.
- If your data model is getting too complicated to handle your authorization within the service.
- If your authorization is growing too complex to handle within code or API gateway.

### Features

üîê Centralize & store authorization data **in house** with high availability.

üîÆ Easily model and refactor your authorization with **Permify's DSL, Permify Schema**.

üìù **Audit & Reason** your access control hassle-free with user interface.

ü©∫ Analyze **performance and behavior** of your authorization with tracing tools [jaeger], [signoz] or [zipkin].

‚úÖ Low latency with **parallel graph engine** on authorization checks.

## How it works

Permify stores access control relations on a database you choose and performs authorization checks based on the stored relations. We called that database Write Database (WriteDB) and it behaves as a centralized data source for your authorization system. You can model your authorization with Permify's DSL - Permify Schema and perform access checks with a single API call anywhere on your stack.
